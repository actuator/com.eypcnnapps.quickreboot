Vulnerability Report - `com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot` v1.0.8

---


### Application Information:
- **App Name:** `com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot`
- **Version:** `1.0.8`

### Vulnerability Details:
The application contains multiple exported broadcast receivers without proper permission checks.
### Affected Components:
1. `SystemUI` broadcast receiver
2. `Reboot` broadcast receiver
3. `PowerOff` broadcast receiver
4. `Recovery` broadcast receiver

### Attack Vector:
- Remote broadcast intent with specific action strings

### Vulnerability Description:
The `com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot` application version `1.0.8` for Android has several exported broadcast receivers (`SystemUI`, `Reboot`, `PowerOff`, and `Recovery`).
While there is a check for specific action strings (e.g., `myButtonStart` in the `PowerOff` receiver), there are no evident permission checks, leaving potential for external broadcasts which might cause unintended behavior.

### Proof of Concept (PoC):
1. **For PowerOff:**
   ```java
   Intent powerOffIntent = new Intent();
   powerOffIntent.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot", "com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot.widget.PowerOff"));
   powerOffIntent.setAction("myButtonStart");
   sendBroadcast(powerOffIntent);
   ```


Recommendations: It's advisable to remove the `exported="true"` flag or implement appropriate permissions or input validation checks to ensure only legitimate broadcasts are processed.
