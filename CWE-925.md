Vulnerability Report - `com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot` v1.0.8

---
Summary:

In version 1.0.8 of 'com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot' for Android, there are exposed broadcast receivers, notably 'Recovery' and 'Reboot', which are susceptible to unauthorized broadcasts because of missing input validation. Malicious entities or any apps installed (even without special permissions) have the potential to exploit this vulnerability either remotely, using a specially crafted intent, or locally through the (Android Debug Bridge), posing a risk of Denial of Service attacks on user devices.


### Application Information:
- **App Name:** `com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot`
- **Version:** `1.0.8`

### Vulnerability Details:
The application contains multiple exported broadcast receivers without proper permission checks.
### Affected Components:

1. `Reboot` broadcast receiver
2. `Recovery` broadcast receiver

### Attack Vector:
- Remote broadcast intent with specific action strings

### Vulnerability Description:
The `com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot` application version `1.0.8` for Android has several exported broadcast receivers (`SystemUI`, `Reboot`, `PowerOff`, and `Recovery`).
While there is a check for specific action strings (e.g., `myButtonStart` in the `PowerOff` receiver), there are no evident permission checks, leaving potential for external broadcasts which might cause unintended behavior.

### Proof of Concept (PoC):
1. **For PowerOff:**
   ```java
   Intent powerOffIntent = new Intent();
   powerOffIntent.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot", "com.eypcnnapps.quickreboot.widget.PowerOff"));
   powerOffIntent.setAction("myButtonStart");
   sendBroadcast(powerOffIntent);
   ```


Recommendations: It's advisable to remove the `exported="true"` flag or implement appropriate permissions or input validation checks to ensure only legitimate broadcasts are processed.
